# PhysicsSim

This repository contains my progress and all the numerical analysis methods of computational physics.
All of these individual methods will eventually be turned into a toolkit that can be used by professional computational physicists 
or developers in the field.

28 September 2025: I will be adding a section to do Computational physics in Python as well
