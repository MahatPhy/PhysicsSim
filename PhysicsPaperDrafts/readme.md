22.09.2025: The current iteration of the paper DiscreteManifoldUniverse.pdf is mathematically consistent but too abstract, which takes away from its elegence as a mathematical theory is meant to provide a simple, consistent and intuitive explanation.

1. The universe can be represented as discrete and finite in R^3, and in higher dimensions can be represented as a manifold.
